== Leader Election

Leader election allows application to work together with other
applications to coordinate a cluster leadership via a third party system.
Currently we provide integrations with `zookeeper` and `hazelcast`.

From user perspective election is working via interfaces
`org.springframework.cloud.cluster.leader.Candidate` and
`org.springframework.cloud.cluster.leader.Context`. `Candidate`
contains access to leadership's `role` and `id` and also have methods
`onGranted` and `onRevoked`. These callback methods are useful if
default `Candidate` implementation is changed.

Leader election is auto-configured if either
`spring-cloud-cluster-hazelcast` or
`spring-cloud-cluster-zookeeper` jars are found from a classpath. In
case where both jars are found leader election is created using both
systems. See sections <<spring-cloud-cluster-leaderelection-zookeeper>>
and <<spring-cloud-cluster-leaderelection-hazelcast>> for more
information about a created beans.

Default `Candidate` created from auto-configuration is
`org.springframework.cloud.cluster.leader.DefaultCandidate` which
currently only logs granted and revoked events.

If there's a need for disable all leader related auto-configuration,
a `spring.cloud.cluster.leader.enabled` can be set to false which
then allows to do manual configuration even if the jars an on a
classpath. Properties `spring.cloud.cluster.leader.id` and
`spring.cloud.cluster.leader.role` can be used to set default
identifier and role.

If you are interested to simple get notification of granted and
revoked events one option is to attach event listener into spring
application context. Events `OnGrantedEvent` and `OnRevokedEvent` are
sent as spring event objects.

Simply create your own event listener class:
[source,java]
----
class MyEventListener implements ApplicationListener<AbstractLeaderEvent> {

  @Override
  public void onApplicationEvent(AbstractLeaderEvent event) {
    // do something with OnGrantedEvent or OnRevokedEvent
  }
}
----

and then create it as a bean.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
static class Config {
  @Bean
  public MyEventListener myEventListener() {
    return new MyEventListener();
  }
}
----

For simply log events you can also use a utility class
`LoggingListener` which allows easy configuration.

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.cluster.leader.event.LoggingListener;

@Configuration
static class Config {
  @Bean
  public LoggingListener loggingListener() {
    return new LoggingListener("info");
  }
}
----

[[spring-cloud-cluster-leaderelection-zookeeper]]
=== Zookeeper
`Candidate` implementation for zookeeper is created with a bean name
`zookeeperLeaderCandidate` which can be used to override the one
created during auto-configuration.

Zookeeper based election can be explicitly disabled using property
`spring.cloud.cluster.zookeeper.enabled`.

Other propertys `spring.cloud.cluster.zookeeper.namespace` and
`spring.cloud.cluster.zookeeper.connect` can be used to set the
zookeeper base namespace path and connect string.

[[spring-cloud-cluster-leaderelection-hazelcast]]
=== Hazelcast
`Candidate` implementation for zookeeper is created with a bean name
`hazelcastLeaderCandidate` which can be used to override the one
created during auto-configuration.

Hazelcast based election can be explicitly disabled using property
`spring.cloud.cluster.hazelcast.enabled`. If you want to provide xml
based configuration for Hazelcast instance use property
`spring.cloud.cluster.hazelcast.config-location` to tell location of a
Hazelcast xml configuration file. `config-location` is a normal spring
`Resource`.
